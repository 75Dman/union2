Article 11: vacation leave with pay
11.01 Vacation year
The vacation year shall be from April 1 to March 31 of the following year, inclusively.

or
c. thirteen decimal three four (13.34) hours per month commencing with the month in which the employee's eighth (8th) anniversary of service occurs,
or

However, the above exception shall not apply to an employee who receives severance pay on layoff and is reappointed to the public service within one (1) year following the date of layoff. For greater certainty, severance payments taken under clauses 14.09 to 14.12, or similar provisions in other collective agreements, do not reduce the calculation of service for persons who have not yet left the public service.
j. For the purpose of clause 11.02 only, effective April 1, 2012, on a go-forward basis, any former service in the Canadian Forces for a continuous period of six (6) months or more, either as a member of the Regular Force or of the Reserve Force while on Class B or C service, shall also be included in the calculation of vacation leave credits.

Scheduling of vacation leave with pay
11.04 Subject to clauses 11.05, 11.06 and 11.07, employees shall, subject to work requirements, normally take all their vacation leave during the vacation year in which it is earned.
11.05 The Employer shall, subject to work requirements, approve vacation leave earned in the current or prior year(s) at a time convenient to the employee.
11.06 In order to ensure that vacation leave is used in accordance with clauses 11.03 and 11.04, any employee with more than one hundred and twenty (120) hours remaining on December 1 of that vacation year shall meet and discuss with his or her supervisor when they are going to use that portion of their leave in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) hours by March 31 of the same vacation year. If they cannot reach an agreement the Employer will schedule such leave subject to clause 11.07.

and
B. the total amount of leave is large and cannot be used within one (1) year.

and
ii. has satisfied all of the other eligibility criteria specified in paragraph 13.06(a), other than those specified in sections (A) and (B) of subparagraph 13.06(a)(iii);

These historical provisions are being reproduced to reflect the agreed language in case of deferred payment.
Article 14: severance pay
Effective October 15, 2012, clauses 14.03 and 14.04 are deleted from the collective agreement.
14.01 For the purpose of this article, the terms:

14.02 Layoff
An employee with one (1) or more years of continuous employment who is laid off shall be paid severance pay based on completed years of continuous employment. It shall be calculated at the rate of two (2) weeks' pay for the first (1st) year of continuous employment or three (3) weeks' pay for employees with ten (10) or more and less than twenty (20) years' continuous employment, or four (4) weeks' pay for employees with twenty (20) or more years of continuous employment, plus one (1) week's pay for each succeeding completed year of continuous employment on the first layoff and one (1) week's pay for each completed year of continuous employment on a subsequent layoff. In the case of a partial year of continuous employment, one (1) week's pay multiplied by the number of days of continuous employment divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365).
14.03 Resignation
An employee who has ten (10) or more years of continuous employment on resignation shall be paid severance pay calculated by multiplying half the employee's weekly rate of pay on resignation by the number of completed years of continuous employment to a maximum of twenty-six (26) years.

An employee who is entitled to an immediate annuity or an immediate annual allowance under the Public Service Superannuation Act, or who has five (5) years of continuous employment and who has attained the age of fifty-five (55) years and has resigned, shall be paid severance pay calculated by multiplying the employee's weekly rate of pay on termination of employment by the number of completed years of continuous employment to a maximum of thirty (30) years.
14.05 Death
Regardless of any other payment to an employee's estate, if the employee dies there shall be paid to the estate, severance pay calculated by multiplying the employee's weekly rate of pay at the time of death by the number of completed years of continuous employment to a maximum of thirty (30) years.

Under no circumstances shall the maximum severance pay provided under this article be pyramided.
For greater certainty, payments made pursuant to clauses 14.09 to 14.12 or similar provisions in other collective agreements shall be considered as a termination benefit for the administration of this article.
14.08 Appointment to a separate agency
An employee who resigns to accept an appointment with an organization listed in Schedule V of the Financial Administration Act shall be paid all severance payments resulting from the application of clause 14.03 (prior to date of signing) or clauses 14.09 to 14.12 (commencing date of signing).

**Appendix C: Memorandum of agreement on supporting employee wellness
This Memorandum of Agreement is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Employer and the Bargaining Agent (hereinafter referred to as "the parties") regarding issues of employee wellness.
The parties have engaged in meaningful negotiations and co-development of comprehensive EWSP language and program design to capture the key features and other recommendations agreed to by the technical committee and steering committee.
The program and its principles focus on improving employee wellness and the reintegration of employees into the workplace after periods of leave due to illness or injury. The EWSP will be comprised of three parts:
1. The existing sick leave provisions of the collective agreement will be retained;
2. A new paid short-term disability plan;
3. Modifications to the existing disability insurance plan to transition to the new EWSP.
Part 1: Sick leave
The existing sick leave provisions of the collective agreement will be maintained.
An employee’s unused sick leave credits will be converted to a sick leave bank, which can be used during the short-term disability waiting period, for short-term disability top up and to cover absences due to illness that are not covered by the short-term disability plan.
Part 2: Short-term disability (STD) plan
The STD plan will be mandatory and provide coverage for all indeterminate and term employees greater than three (3) months.
The plan will provide income protection for employees who are unable to work for a lengthy period because of illness or injury.
The STD plan will be seamless with the existing disability insurance plan.
The STD plan will come into effect on the date of implementation of the EWSP. On that date, the accumulation of new sick leave credits under the collective agreement will cease.
The STD plan will have the following features:
• Benefits for up to 26 weeks (130 working days) with income support replacement at 90% of the employee’s salary.
• A 7-day waiting period for most illnesses and injuries.
• A 1-day waiting period for employees who are hospitalized, who are undergoing surgery and for those with chronic and episodic illnesses.
• Employees can use their sick leave credits to cover the waiting period and to top up their STD benefit from 90% to 100%.
• Travel time for diagnosis and treatment will not be covered by the STD plan. Employees can use their sick leave credits to cover these absences.
• Absences due to illness and injury that are not covered by the STD plan, such as short-term illnesses, can be covered by the employee’s sick leave credits.
Part 3: Disability insurance (DI) plan
The DI plan will continue to provide income protection for employees who have exhausted their STD benefits and who are unable to return to work.
The DI plan will be modified to include the following features:
• A new benefit of 85% of salary, which will be available after the 26-week STD period ends.
• An increase to the salary threshold for catastrophic injuries from $150,000 to $200,000.
• A new provision that will allow employees to work while on DI and still receive a partial benefit.
The changes to the DI plan will come into effect on the date of implementation of the EWSP.
The parties agree to continue to work together to develop the full details of the EWSP, including the governance structure and the claims adjudication process. The parties also agree to meet within 180 days of the signing of this agreement to finalize the implementation of the EWSP.
**Appendix D: Memorandum of understanding between the Treasury Board of Canada and the Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association with respect to gender-inclusive language
This memorandum is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Treasury Board of Canada and the Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association regarding the review of language in the Association collective agreement.
Both parties are committed to and support gender neutrality and inclusivity. To that end, the parties commit to, during the life of the above-noted collective agreements, establishing a Joint Committee to review the collective agreements to identify opportunities to render the language more gender-inclusive. The parties agree that any changes in language will not result in changes in application, scope or value.
Both parties acknowledge that gender inclusivity is more difficult to achieve in the French language compared to the English language, but are committed nonetheless to further supporting and increasing gender neutrality and inclusivity in the collective agreement.
The Joint Committee agrees to begin their work and will endeavor to finalize the review by December 2022. These timelines may be extended by mutual agreement.
**Appendix E: Memorandum of understanding with respect to implementation of the collective agreement
This memorandum of understanding (MOU) is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Employer and the Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association regarding issues concerning the implementation of the collective agreement.
The parties acknowledge that the Phoenix pay system issues have created unforeseen and unprecedented challenges for the implementation of collective agreements in the federal public service. As such, the parties have agreed to the following measures to facilitate the implementation of this collective agreement:
1. The collective agreement will be implemented within 180 days of its signing.
2. The Employer will provide a detailed breakdown of the retroactive payments to each employee.
3. The Employer will provide a $250 lump-sum payment to each employee in recognition of the extended implementation timeline and the additional work required to validate the retroactive payments. This payment will be made within 180 days of the signing of the collective agreement.
4. The Employer will provide a report to the Association on the status of the implementation of the collective agreement every 90 days.
5. The parties will meet within 90 days of the signing of the collective agreement to discuss the lessons learned from the implementation of this collective agreement and to identify best practices for future negotiations.

**Appendix F: Memorandum of understanding between the Treasury Board of Canada and the Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association with respect to workplace harassment
This memorandum is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Treasury Board and the Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association.
Both parties share the objective of creating healthy work environments that are free from harassment and violence. In the context of the passage of Bill C-65 An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code by the Government of Canada, as well as the Clerk of the Privy Council's initiative to take action to eliminate workplace harassment, the Treasury Board is developing a new directive covering both harassment and violence situations.
During this process, the Treasury Board will consult with the members of National Joint Council (NJC) on the following:
• mechanisms to guide and support employees through the harassment resolution process;
• redress for the detrimental impacts on an employee resulting from an incident of harassment;
and
• ensuring that employees can report harassment without fear of reprisal.
The Employer also agrees to hold bilateral discussion with the Association if the Association requests it. Any report resulting from these discussions will be shared with the NJC.
The implementation and application of this directive do not fall within the purview of this MOU or the collective agreement.
This memorandum expires upon issuance of the new directive or March 31, 2022, whichever comes first.

This memorandum of understanding (MoU) is to give effect to an agreement reached between the Treasury Board (the Employer) and the Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association to implement a system of cost recovery for leave for Union business.
The parties agree to this MoU as a direct result of current Phoenix pay system implementation concerns related to the administration of leave without pay for Union business.
The MoU shall form part of the Ship Repair Chargehands (SR(C)) collective agreement expiring March 31, 2022.
• Leave granted to an employee under the following clauses of the collective agreement: 21.06, 21.07 and 21.08 will be with pay for a total cumulative maximum period of three (3) months per fiscal year.
• It is agreed that leave with pay granted under the above-noted clauses for Union business will be paid for by the Employer pursuant to this MoU, effective upon its signature.
• Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association shall then reimburse the Employer for the actual gross salary paid for each person-day, in addition to which shall also be paid to the Employer by the Association an amount equal to six per cent (6%) of the actual gross salary paid for each person-day, which sum represents the Employer's contribution for the benefits the employee acquired at work during the period of approved leave with pay pursuant to this MoU.
• On a bimonthly basis, and within 120 days of the end of the relevant period of leave, the hiring Department/Agency will invoice the Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association for the amount owed to them by virtues of this understanding. The amount of the gross salaries and the number of days of leave taken for each employee will be included in the statement.
• Federal Government Dockyard Chargehands Association agrees to reimburse the Department/Agency for the invoice within sixty (60) days of the date of the invoice.
