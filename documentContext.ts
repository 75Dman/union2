The vacation year shall be from April 1 to March 31 of the following year, inclusively.

An employee shall earn, during the vacation year, vacation leave credits at the following rates for
each calendar month during which the employee receives at least eighty (80) hours pay:
a. six decimal six seven (6.67) hours per month until the month (for an annual total of ten
(10) days) in which the anniversary of the employee's first (1st) year of service occurs;
or
b. ten (10) hours per month (for an annual total of fifteen (15) days) commencing with
the month in which the employee's first (1st) anniversary of service occurs;

(20) days) commencing with the month in which the employee's eight
(8th) anniversary of service occurs;

(22) days) commencing with the month in which the employee's fifteenth
(15th) anniversary of service occurs;

(23) days) commencing with the month in which the employee's seventeenth

(25) days) commencing with the month in which the employee's eighteenth
(18th) anniversary of service occurs;

any former service in the Canadian Forces for a continuous period of six (6) months or
more, either as a member of the Regular Force or of the Reserve Force while on
class B or C service, shall also be included in the calculation of vacation leave credits.
For greater certainty, severance termination benefits taken under clauses 14.10 to
14.13, or similar provisions in other collective agreements, do not reduce the
calculation of service for employees who have not left the public service.
10.03 Entitlement to vacation leave with pay
An employee is entitled to vacation leave with pay to the extent of the employee's earned credits
but an employee who has completed six (6) months of continuous employment may receive an

Scheduling of vacation leave with pay

normally take all their vacation leave during the vacation year in which it is earned.
10.05 The Employer shall, subject to work requirements, schedule vacation leave at a time
convenient to the employee.
10.06 In order to ensure that vacation leave is used in accordance with clauses 10.04 and 10.05,
any employee with more than one hundred and twenty (120) hours on January 1 of that fiscal
year, shall meet and discuss with his or her supervisor when they are going to use the portion of
their leave over the one hundred and twenty (120) hours by March 31 of the same fiscal year. If

10.07 Carry-over provisions
a. An employee may carry over a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) hours as
stated in clause 10.06.
b. By November 1 of each year, requests to carry over vacation leave in excess of one

and

ii.
Carry-over of such vacation leave will be allowed under the following
circumstances:

vacation leave;

classification prescribed in the employee's certificate of appointment of the
employee's substantive position on March 31, of the previous vacation year.
e.

approved in writing, the Employer shall reimburse the employee for the non-returnable
portion of vacation contracts and reservations made by the employee in respect of that
period, subject to the presentation of such documentation as the Employer may require.
The employee must make every reasonable attempt to mitigate such losses.
Leave when employment terminates
10.08 When an employee dies or otherwise ceases to be employed, the employee or the
employee's estate shall be paid an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the
number of days earned but unused vacation with pay to the employee's credit by the daily rate of
pay (that is rate in effect at time of termination) to which the employee is entitled by virtue of the
certificate of appointment in effect at the time of the termination of employment.
10.09 In the event of termination of employment for reasons other than death, the Employer shall
recover from any monies owed the employee an amount equivalent to unearned vacation leave
taken by the employee, calculated on the basis of the daily rate of pay (that is rate in effect at
time of termination) to which the employee is entitled by virtue of the certificate of appointment
in effect at the time of the termination of employment.
Advance payments
10.10 In view of special circumstances concerning this group, the Employer agrees to issue
advance payments of estimated net salary for the period of vacation requested, provided four
(4) weeks' notice is received from the employee prior to the last pay day before proceeding

concerned, the Employer agrees to issue advance payments of estimated net salary for a period of
two (2) or more complete weeks.
10.12 Any overpayments in respect of such pay advances shall be an immediate first charge
against any subsequent pay entitlements and shall be recovered in full prior to any further
payment of salary.
One-time leave entitlement
10.13 Employees shall be credited a one-time entitlement of twenty-four (24) hours of vacation
leave with pay on the first (1st) day of the month following the anniversary of the employee's
first (1st) year of service.
10.14 Where, in respect of any period of vacation leave, an employee is granted sick leave on
production of a medical certificate which includes the name, address and phone number of the
attending physician, and provided that the employee satisfies the Employer of this condition if
deemed necessary by the Employer, the period of vacation leave so displaced shall either be
added to the vacation period if requested by the employee and approved by the Employer or
reinstated for the use at a later date. Employees are to advise the Employer as soon as possible of

has signed an agreement with the Employer stating that:
**
A. she will return to work within the federal public administration, as

time worked. Periods of leave without pay during the employee's return to work will

pay for each week of the waiting period, less any other monies earned during
this period,
and
ii.
for each week that the employee receives a maternity benefit under the
Employment Insurance or the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan, she is eligible to
receive the difference between ninety-three per cent (93%) of her weekly rate of

been eligible if no extra monies had been earned during this period.

under Employment Insurance and thereafter remains on maternity leave without
pay, she is eligible to receive a further maternity allowance for a period of one

provides proof of receipt of Employment Insurance or Quebec Parental Insurance Plan
maternity benefits.

increase the maternity allowance, the allowance shall be adjusted accordingly.

increase an employee's deferred remuneration or severance pay.
13.07 Special maternity allowance for totally disabled employees

Public Service Management Insurance Plan (PSMIP) or the Government
Employees Compensation Act prevents her from receiving Employment
Insurance or Quebec Parental Insurance Plan maternity benefits;
and

Grievance procedure
19.05 For the purposes of this article, a grievor is an employee or, in the case of a group or
policy grievance, the Council.
19.06 No person shall seek by intimidation, by threat of dismissal or by any other kind of threat
to cause a grievor to abandon a grievance or refrain from exercising the right to present a
grievance, as provided in this collective agreement.
19.07 The parties recognize the value of informal discussion between employees and their
supervisors and between the Council and the Employer to the end that problems might be
resolved without recourse to a formal grievance. When notice is given that an employee or the
Council, within the time limits prescribed in clause 19.15, wishes to take advantage of this
clause, it is agreed that the period between the initial discussion and the final response shall not
count as elapsed time for the purpose of grievance time limits.
19.08 A grievor wishing to present a grievance at any prescribed level in the grievance
procedure, shall transmit this grievance to the employee's immediate supervisor or local officer-
in-charge who shall forthwith:
a. forward the grievance to the representative of the Employer authorized to deal with
grievances at the appropriate level,
and
b. provide the grievor with a receipt stating the date on which the grievance was received.
19.09 A grievance shall not be deemed to be invalid by reason only of the fact that it is not in
accordance with the form supplied by the Employer.
19.10 Subject to and as provided for in the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, a grievor
who feels treated unjustly or aggrieved by an action or lack of action by the Employer in matters
other than those arising from the classification process is entitled to present a grievance in the
manner prescribed in clause 19.08, except that:
a. where there is another administrative procedure provided by or under any act of
Parliament to deal with the grievor's specific complaint such procedure must be
followed,
and
b. where the grievance relates to the interpretation or application of this collective
agreement or an Arbitral Award, an employee is not entitled to present the grievance
unless he has the approval of and is represented by the Council.
19.11 There shall be no more than a maximum of four (4) levels in the grievance procedure.
These levels shall be as follows:
a.
Level 1, first level of management;
b. Levels 2 and 3 in departments or agencies where such a levels are established
intermediate level(s);
c. Final level, chief executive or deputy head or an authorized representative.
Whenever there are four (4) levels in the grievance procedure, the grievor may elect to waive
either Level 2 or 3.
No employer representative may hear the same grievance at more than one level in the grievance
procedure.
19.12 The Employer shall designate a representative at each level in the grievance procedure and
shall inform each employee to whom the procedure applies of the name or title of the person so
designated together with the name or title and address of the immediate supervisor or local
officer-in-charge to whom a grievance is to be presented.
**
19.13 This information shall be communicated to employees by means of notices posted by the
Employer in places where such notices are most likely to come to the attention of the employees
to whom the grievance procedure applies, or otherwise as determined by agreement between the
Employer and the Council. For the purposes of satisfying the Employer's obligation under this
clause, the notices may be posted electronically. Where electronic access is unavailable or
impractical a paper copy will be posted.
19.14 An employee may be assisted and/or represented by the Council when presenting a
grievance at any level. The Council shall have the right to consult with the Employer with
respect to a grievance at each or any level of the grievance procedure.
19.15 A grievor may present a grievance to the first level of the procedure in the manner
prescribed in clause 19.08, not later than the twenty-fifth (25th) day after the date on which the
grievor is notified or on which the grievor first becomes aware of the action or circumstances
giving rise to the grievance. The Employer may present a policy grievance in the manner
prescribed in clause 19.04 not later than the twenty-fifth (25th) day after the date on which the
Employer is notified orally or in writing or on which the Employer first becomes aware of the
action or circumstances giving rise to the policy grievance.
19.16 A grievor may present a grievance at each succeeding level in the grievance procedure
beyond the first level either:
a.
where the decision or settlement is not satisfactory to the grievor, within ten (10) days
after that decision or settlement has been conveyed in writing to the grievor by the
Employer,
or
b. where the Employer has not conveyed a decision to the grievor within the time prescribed
in clause 19.17, within fifteen (15) days after presentation by the grievor of the grievance
at the previous level.
19.17 The Employer shall normally reply to a grievance at any level of the grievance procedure,
except the final level, within twenty (20) days after the grievance is presented, and within thirty
(30) days where the grievance is presented at the final level except in the case of a policy
grievance, to which the Employer shall normally respond within sixty (60) days. The Council
shall normally reply to a policy grievance presented by the Employer within sixty (60) days.
19.18 Where an employee has been represented by the Council in the presentation of the
employee's grievance, the Employer will provide the appropriate representative of the Council
with a copy of the Employer's decision at each level of the grievance procedure at the same time
that the Employer's decision is conveyed to the employee.
19.19 The decision given by the Employer at the final level in the grievance procedure shall be
final and binding upon the employee unless the grievance is a class of grievance that may be
referred to adjudication.
19.20 In determining the time within which any action is to be taken as prescribed in this
procedure, Saturdays, Sundays and designated paid holidays shall be excluded.
19.21 Where the provisions of clause 19.08 cannot be complied with and it is necessary to
present a grievance by mail, the grievance shall be deemed to have been presented on the day on
which it is postmarked and it shall be deemed to have been received by the Employer on the day
it is delivered to the appropriate office of the department or agency concerned. Similarly, the
Employer shall be deemed to have delivered a reply at any level on the date on which the letter
containing the reply is postmarked, but the time limit within which the grievor may present the
grievance at the next higher level shall be calculated from the date on which the Employer's
reply was delivered to the address shown on the grievance form.
19.22 The time limits stipulated in this procedure may be extended by mutual agreement
between the Employer and the grievor and, where appropriate the Council representative.
19.23 Where it appears that the nature of the grievance is such that a decision cannot be given
below a particular level of authority, any or all the levels except the final level may be eliminated
by agreement of the Employer and the grievor, and, where applicable, the Council.
19.24 Where the Employer demotes or terminates an employee for cause pursuant to
paragraph 12(1)(c), (d) or (e) of the Financial Administration Act, the grievance procedure set forth
in this agreement shall apply except that the grievance shall be presented at the final level only.
19.25 A grievor may by written notice to the immediate supervisor or officer-in-charge abandon
a grievance.
19.26 Any grievor who fails to present a grievance to the next higher level within the prescribed
time limits shall be deemed to have abandoned the grievance unless, due to circumstances
beyond the grievor's control, the grievor was unable to comply with the prescribed time limits.
19.27 Where a grievance has been presented up to and including the final level in the grievance
procedure with respect to:
a. the interpretation or application of a provision of this collective agreement or related
Arbitral Award,
or
b. termination of employment or demotion pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(c), (d) or (e) of the
Financial Administration Act,
or
c. disciplinary action resulting in suspension or financial penalty,
and the grievance has not been dealt with to the grievor's satisfaction, it may be referred to
adjudication in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations
Act and Regulations.
19.28 Where a grievance that may be presented by an employee to adjudication is a grievance
relating to the interpretation or application in respect of the employee of a provision of this
agreement or an Arbitral Award, the employee is not entitled to refer the grievance to
adjudication unless the Council signifies:
a. its approval of the reference of the grievance to adjudication,
and
b. its willingness to represent the employee in the adjudication proceedings.
Article 20: safety and health
20.01 The Employer shall make all reasonable provisions for the occupational safety and health

employment which may be the direct result of any major improvements.

criteria. The completion date of the apprenticeship program will remain as stated in the
employee's letter of offer unless there is a requirement for make-up time to meet
industry/departmental standards.
The APA and APB sub-groups are being used only for pay purposes and not for
classification.
4. The pay increment date for an employee appointed to a position in the bargaining unit on
promotion, demotion or appointment from outside the public service, shall be every twelve
(12) month period, on the anniversary date of such appointment or the date on which the
employee received his or her last pay increment.
**Appendix "B”
Memorandum of Agreement on Supporting Employee Wellness
This memorandum of agreement is to give effect to the agreement reached between the
Employer and the bargaining agent (hereinafter referred to as “the parties”) regarding issues of
employee wellness. This MOA replaces the prior Employee Wellness MOA previously signed.
The parties have engaged in meaningful negotiations and co-development of comprehensive
EWSP language and program design to capture the key features and other recommendations
agreed to by the technical committee and steering committee, which is reflected in the Plan
Document agreed to by the parties on May 26, 2019.
The program and its principles focus on improving employee wellness and the reintegration of
employees into the workplace after periods of leave due to illness or injury. The previous MOA
identified the following key features:
•
contained in collective agreements;
•
benefits for up to 26 weeks (130 working days) with income support replacement
at 100%;
•
the annual allotment shall be 9 days of paid sick leave for illness or injury that falls
outside of the parameters of the EWSP;
•
100% income replacement during the 3 day (working) qualification period when the
employee's claim is approved;
•
qualifying chronic or episodic illnesses will be exempt of the waiting period;
•
the qualification period will be waived in cases of hospitalization or recurrence of a prior
illness or injury approved under EWSP within 30 days;
•
employees are entitled to carry over a maximum of 3 days of unused sick leave credits
remaining at the end of the fiscal year, for use in the following fiscal year;
•
the accumulation of current sick leave credits will cease once the EWSP is implemented.
Employees with banked sick leave in excess of 26 weeks, will be entitled to carry over
those excess days to provide extended coverage at 100% income replacement prior to
accessing LTD;
•
travel time for diagnosis and treatment;
•
internal case management and return-to-work services focused on supporting employees
when ill or injured;
•
an employee on EWSP will be considered to be on leave with pay;
•
full costs of administering the EWSP to be borne by Employer;
and
•
increase the quantum of family related leave by one (1) day.
The Plan Document approved on May 26, 2019, takes precedence over the principles, if there's a
difference in interpretation.
Process
The parties agree to continue the work of the TBS / Bargaining Agent Employee Wellness
Support Program (EWSP) Steering Committee, which will focus on finalizing a service delivery
model for program implementation, including its governance, for the improvement of employee
wellness and the reintegration of employees into the workplace after periods of leave due to
illness or injury.
As required, the Steering Committee will direct a sub-committee to make recommendations on
the overall implementation, service delivery and governance issues of the Program. As a first
priority, the Steering Committee will develop a planning framework with timelines to guide
work toward the timely implementation of the new EWSP. A governance model will be
developed taking in to account there will be only one (1) EWSP.
The Steering Committee will complete the necessary work on overall implementation, including
service delivery and governance issues no later than March 21, 2020, a date which can be moved
based on mutual agreement of the parties.
If accepted by the Steering Committee, the recommendation(s) concerning program
implementation, including service delivery and governance, as well as the proposal for the
EWSP itself, approval will be sought on these elements from the Treasury Board of Canada and
by the bargaining units.
If approved by both parties, the parties mutually consent to re-open the collective agreement to
vary the agreement only insofar as to include the EWSP wording, and include consequential
changes. No further items are to be varied through this reopener; the sole purpose will be EWSP-
related modifications. The EWSP Program would be included in the relevant collective
agreements only as a reopener.
Should the parties not be able to reach agreement on EWSP, the existing sick leave provisions, as
currently stipulated in collective agreements, will remain in force.
For greater certainty, this MOA forms part of the collective agreement.
Appendix “C”
Archived Provisions for the Elimination of Severance Pay for Voluntary
Separations (Resignation and Retirement)
This appendix is to reflect the language signed by the Employer and the Federal Government
Dockyard Trades and Labour Council (East) for the elimination of severance pay for voluntary
separations (resignation and retirement) on September 18, 2013. These historical provisions are
being reproduced to reflect the signed language in cases of deferred payment.
Article 14: severance pay
Effective September 18, 2013, clauses 14.03 and 14.04 are deleted from the collective
agreement.
14.01 For the purpose of this article, the terms:
a. "Employer” includes any organization, service with which is included in the
calculation of “continuous employment”;
b. “weekly rate of pay” means the employee's hourly rate of pay as set out in
Appendix "A" multiplied by forty (40) applying to the employee's classification, as
shown in the instrument of appointment.
14.02 Lay-off
Under the following circumstances and subject to clause 14.08, an employee with one (1) or
more years of continuous employment who is laid off after April 7, 1971, shall be paid severance
pay based on completed years of continuous employment, less any period within the period of
continuous employment in respect of which the employee was granted a termination of
employment benefit paid by the Employer. It shall be calculated at the rate of:
a. On the first (1st) lay-off, for the first (1st) year of continuous employment, two
(2) weeks' pay, or three (3) weeks' pay for employees with ten (10) or more and less than
twenty (20) years of continuous employment, or four (4) weeks' pay for employees with
twenty (20) or more years of continuous employment, plus one (1) week's pay for each
succeeding completed year of continuous employment, and in the case of a partial year of
continuous employment, one (1) week's pay multiplied by the number of days of
continuous employment divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365).
b. On the second (2nd) or subsequent lay-off, one (1) week's pay for each complete year of
continuous employment and, in the case of a partial year of continuous employment, one
(1) week's pay multiplied by the number of days of continuous employment divided by
three hundred and sixty-five (365), less any period in respect of which the employee was
granted severance pay under paragraph 14.02(a).
14.03 Resignation
An employee who has ten (10) or more years of continuous employment on resignation shall be
paid severance pay calculated by multiplying half the employee's weekly rate of pay on
resignation by the number of completed years of continuous employment to a maximum of
twenty-six (26) years, less any period within that period of continuous employment in respect of
which the employee was granted a termination of employment benefit paid by the Employer.
14.04 Retirement
An employee who is entitled to an immediate annuity or an immediate annual allowance under
the Public Service Superannuation Act, or who has five (5) years of continuous employment and
who has attained the age of fifty-five (55) years and has resigned, shall be paid severance pay
calculated by multiplying the employee's weekly rate of pay on termination of employment by
the number of completed years of continuous employment to a maximum of thirty (30) years,
less any period within that period of continuous employment in respect of which the employee
was granted a termination of employment benefit paid by the Employer. In the case of a partial
year of continuous employment, one (1) week's pay multiplied by the number of days of
continuous employment divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365).
14.05 Death
If an employee dies, there shall be paid to the employee's estate a severance payment in respect
of the employee's complete period of continuous employment, comprised of one (1) week's pay
for each complete year of continuous employment and, in the case of a partial year of continuous
employment, one (1) week's pay multiplied by the number of days of continuous employment
divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365), to a maximum of thirty (30) weeks' pay,
regardless of any other benefit payable.
14.06 Termination for cause for reasons of incapacity
When an employee ceases to be employed by reason of termination for cause for reason of
incapacity pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(e) of the Financial Administration Act, one (1) week's
pay for each complete year of continuous employment with a maximum benefit of twenty-eight
(28) weeks.
14.07 Rejection on probation
An employee with two (2) or more years of continuous employment who ceases to be employed
for reasons of rejection during the employee's probationary period immediately following a
second or subsequent appointment shall be paid severance pay calculated by multiplying the
employee's weekly rate of pay on rejection during probation by the number of completed years
of continuous employment to a maximum of twenty-seven (27) years less any period within that
period of continuous employment in respect of which the employee was granted a termination of
employment benefit paid by the Employer.
14.08 Continuous employment
The period of continuous employment used in the calculation of severance benefits payable to an
employee under this article shall be reduced by any period of continuous employment in respect
of which the employee was already granted any type of termination benefit. Under no
circumstances shall the maximum severance pay provided under this article be pyramided.
For greater certainty, payments made pursuant to clauses 14.10 to 14.13 or similar provisions in
other collective agreements shall be considered as a termination benefit for the administration of
clause 14.08.
14.09 Appointment to a separate agency
An employee who resigns to accept an appointment with an organization listed in Schedule V of
the Financial Administration Act shall be paid all severance payments resulting from the

or
c. as a combination of (a) and (b), pursuant to paragraph 14.12(c).

**Appendix "D”
Memorandum of Understanding Between the Treasury Board of Canada and the
Federal Government Dockyard Trades and Labour Council (East) With Respect to
Gender-Inclusive Language
This memorandum is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Treasury Board of
Canada and the Federal Government Dockyard Trades and Labour Council (East) regarding the
review of language in the Council collective agreement.
Both parties are committed to and support gender neutrality and inclusivity. To that end, the
parties commit to, during the life of the above-noted collective agreements, establishing a Joint
Committee to review the collective agreements to identify opportunities to render the language
more gender-inclusive. The parties agree that any changes in language will not result in changes
in application, scope or value.
Both parties acknowledge that gender inclusivity is more difficult to achieve in the French
language compared to the English language, but are committed nonetheless to further supporting
and increasing gender neutrality and inclusivity in the collective agreement.
The Joint Committee agrees to begin their work in 2020 and will endeavour to finalize the
review by December 2022. These timelines may be extended by mutual agreement.
**Appendix “E”
Memorandum of Understanding Between the Treasury Board of Canada and the
Federal Government Dockyard Trades and Labour Council (East) With Respect to
Implementation of the Collective Agreement
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 25 on the calculation of retroactive payments and
Article 40 on the collective agreement implementation period, this memorandum is to give effect
to the understanding reached between the Employer and the Federal Government Dockyard
Trades and Labour Council (East) regarding a modified approach to the calculation and
administration of retroactive payments for the current round of negotiations.
1. Calculation of retroactive payments
a.
Retroactive calculations that determine amounts payable to employees for a retroactive
period shall be made based on all transactions that have been entered into the pay
system up to the date on which the historical salary records for the retroactive period
are retrieved for the calculation of the retroactive payment.
b. Retroactive amounts will be calculated by applying the relevant percentage increases
indicated in the collective agreement rather than based on pay tables in agreement
annexes. The value of the retroactive payment will differ from that calculated using the
traditional approach, as no rounding will be applied. The payment of retroactive
amount will not affect pension entitlements or contributions relative to previous
methods, except in respect of the rounding differences.
c.
Elements of salary traditionally included in the calculation of retroactivity will
continue to be included in the retroactive payment calculation and administration, and
will maintain their pensionable status as applicable. The elements of salary included in
the historical salary records and therefore included in the calculation of retroactivity
include:
•
substantive salary
•
promotions
•
deployments
•
acting pay
•
extra duty pay / overtime
•
additional hours worked
•
maternity leave allowance
•
parental leave allowance
•
vacation leave and extra duty pay cash-out
•
severance pay
•
salary for the month of death
•
Transition Support Measure
•
eligible allowances and supplemental salary depending on collective agreement
d. The payment of retroactive amounts related to transactions that have not been entered
in the pay system as of the date when the historical salary records are retrieved, such
as acting pay, promotions, overtime and/or deployments, will not be considered in
determining whether an agreement has been implemented.
e.
Any outstanding pay transactions will be processed once they are entered into the pay
system and any retroactive payment from the collective agreement will be issued to
impacted employees.
2. Implementation
a.
The effective dates for economic increases will be specified in the agreement. Other
provisions of the collective agreement will be effective as follows:
i.
All components of the agreement unrelated to pay administration will come into
force on signature of agreement.
ii.
Changes to existing compensation elements and new compensation elements such
as premiums, allowances, insurance premiums and coverage and changes to
overtime rates will become effective within one hundred and eighty (180) days
after signature of agreement, on the date at which prospective elements of
compensation increases will be implemented under 2(b)(i).
iii.
Payment of premiums, allowances, insurance premiums and coverage and
overtime rates in the collective agreement will continue to be paid until changes
come in to force as stipulated in 2(a)(ii).
b. Collective agreement will be implemented over the following timeframes:
i.
The prospective elements of compensation increases (such as prospective salary
rate changes and other compensation elements such as premiums, allowances,
changes to overtime rates) will be implemented within one hundred and eighty
(180) days after signature of agreement where there is no need for manual
intervention.
ii.
Retroactive amounts payable to employees will be implemented within one
hundred and eighty (180) days after signature of the agreement where there is no
need for manual intervention.
iii.
Prospective compensation increases and retroactive amounts that require manual
processing by compensation advisors will be implemented within five hundred
and sixty (560) days after signature of agreement. Manual intervention is
generally required for employees on an extended period of leave without pay
(e.g., maternity/parental leave), salary protected employees and those with
transactions such as leave with income averaging, pre-retirement transition leave
and employees paid below minimum, above maximum or in between steps.
Manual intervention may also be required for specific accounts with complex
salary history.
3. Employee recourse
a. An employee who is in the bargaining unit for all or part of the period between the first
day of the collective agreement (i.e., the day after the expiry of the previous collective
agreement) and the signature date of the collective agreement will be entitled to a non-
pensionable amount of four hundred dollars ($400) payable within one hundred and
eighty (180) days of signature, in recognition of extended implementation timeframes and
the significant number of transactions that have not been entered in the pay system as of
the date when the historical salary records are retrieved.
b. Employees in the bargaining unit for whom the collective agreement is not implemented
within one hundred and eighty-one (181) days after signature will be entitled to a fifty-
dollar ($50) non-pensionable amount; these employees will be entitled to an additional
fifty-dollar ($50) non-pensionable amount for every subsequent complete period of
ninety (90) days their collective agreement is not implemented, to a total maximum of
nine (9) payments. These amounts will be included in their final retroactive payment. For
greater certainty, the total maximum amount payable under this paragraph is four hundred
and fifty dollars ($450).
c. If an employee is eligible for compensation in respect of section 3 under more than one
collective agreement, the following applies: the employee shall receive only one non-
pensionable amount of four hundred dollars ($400); for any period under 3(b), the
employee may receive one fifty dollar ($50) payment, to a maximum total payment of
four hundred and fifty dollars ($450).
d. Should the Employer negotiate higher amounts for 3(a) or 3(b) with any other bargaining
agent representing core public administration employees, it will compensate FGDTLC
(EAST) members for the difference in an administratively feasible manner.
e. Late implementation of the 2018 collective agreements will not create any entitlements
pursuant to the agreement between the CPA bargaining agents and the Treasury Board of
Canada with regard to damages caused by the Phoenix pay system.
f. Employees for whom collective agreement implementation requires manual intervention
will be notified of the delay within one hundred and eighty (180) days after signature of
the agreement.
g. Employees will be provided a detailed breakdown of the retroactive payments received
and may request that the departmental compensation unit or the Public Service Pay
Centre verify the calculation of their retroactive payments, where they believe these
amounts are incorrect. The Employer will consult with the Council regarding the format
of the detailed breakdown.
h. In such a circumstance, for employees in organizations serviced by the Pay Centre, they
must first complete a Phoenix feedback form indicating what period they believe is
missing from their pay.
**Appendix "F”
Memorandum of Understanding Between the Treasury Board of Canada and the
Federal Government Dockyard Trades and Labour Council (East) With Respect to
Workplace Harassment
This memorandum is to give effect to the agreement reached between the Treasury Board and
the Federal Government Dockyard Trades and Labour Council (East).
Both parties share the objective of creating healthy work environments that are free from
harassment and violence. In the context of the passage of Bill C-65 An Act to amend the Canada
Labour Code by the Government of Canada, as well as the Clerk of the Privy Council's initiative
to take action to eliminate workplace harassment, the Treasury Board is developing a new
directive covering both harassment and violence situations.
During this process, the Treasury Board will consult with the members of National Joint Council
(NJC) on the following:
•
mechanisms to guide and support employees through the harassment resolution process;
•
redress for the detrimental impacts on an employee resulting from an incident of
harassment;
and
•
ensuring that employees can report harassment without fear of reprisal.
The Employer also agrees to hold bilateral discussion with the Council if the Council requests it.
Any report resulting from these discussions will be shared with the NJC.
The implementation and application of this directive do not fall within the purview of this MOU
or the collective agreement.
This memorandum expires upon issuance of the new directive or December 31, 2022, whichever
comes first.

Dear Mr. Brown:
Subject: vehicle/liability
This will confirm that the Employer will, subject to this letter, waive its claim against any
employee in the bargaining unit for reimbursement of damages paid by it to a third party for
bodily injury, death or property damage caused by an accident involving a motor vehicle owned
or rented by the Employer and driven by the employee in the normal course of performing
his/her duties.
The Employer agrees to indemnify an employee in the bargaining unit against any liability
imposed upon him/her, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to pay any damages arising from
bodily injury, death or property damage suffered by a third party and caused by an accident
which occurs while the employee is driving a motor vehicle owned or rented by the Employer,
while in the normal course of performing his/her duties. No employee in the bargaining unit will
be eligible for such indemnification, unless he/she has, prior to the occurrence of such an
accident, executed and delivered to the Employer, an instrument in writing in a form acceptable
to the Employer, having the following effect:
1. constituting and appointing the Employer as irrevocable attorney to appear and defend
in any court of competent jurisdiction in which an action is brought against him/her
claiming damages allegedly arising out of such an accident,
and
2. authorizing the Employer to conduct all negotiations in respect of such damages and to
effect any settlement relating to the payment thereof.
None of the undertakings described in this letter will apply where the accident occurred while the
employee was driving a vehicle owned or rented by the Employer outside the scope of his/her
employment.
This letter of understanding will expire on December 31, 2022.
